﻿# ST457 - Graph Data Analytics and Representation Learning: Assignment 3 (2023, Spring)

### Overall objective

This project is intended i) to assess your overall knowledge related to graphs/networks, specifically the concepts and techniques we discussed during the lectures and seminars, ii) to give you the opportunity to design a graph/network project on a topic of your choice, and iii) to allow you to work as a data science team.

### Instructions

1. **GROUPS**: This is a group project, with 3-4 students. The group is expected to design a solid solution, with each member engaged uniformly (it is your responsibility to make sure that everybody is working towards the goal). If you need to find someone else to form a group with you, check our [Cryptpad sheet](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/vXe0Kz+3UffbkgU04gXFs6vI/) and contact your prospective teammates. Note: Sometimes Cryptpad is a bit 'relaxed'; if you experience that you can not edit the sheet, just re-load the page.

2. **TOPIC, SOFTWARE, DATA**: Choose a topic for which you want to design a graph/network-based solution. Make sure to identify good research questions and contributions that you can address. You can pick one of the following

    - reproduce a given study, based on a set of research papers, and add your own contributions and findings, 
    - design a graph/network-based solution for a particular problem and compare your approach to existing approaches for solving this problem.

    You can rely on existing software or library. There is no expectation that you will design a completely new approach, but you are supposed to show a good understanding and mastery of the techniques you chose, to propose potential improvements, and to discuss in detail their performance. 

    Make sure that you identify a consistent set of real data to use in your application. You can also generate synthetic data in case you don't find real data. Also, you can use any existing dataset(s) and import these data into your project. Have a clear understanding of the data and use data of good quality/completeness. There is no need to investigate very large datasets.

3. **WRITING**:
Writing a paper in data science follows a 'standard' protocol. Familiarize yourself with the writing etiquette---if you have not yet done so---and apply it in your project report. Probably the most time-efficient way to absorb this style are works which obtained best paper award or chosen to be oral presentation at top-tier conference venues ([NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), [ICML](https://icml.cc/), [AISTATS](https://aistats.org/aistats2023/), [UAI](https://www.auai.org/uai2023/)) or were published in [JMLR](https://jmlr.org/). Select a few past publications with this in mind, and observe how the authors

    1. justify the importance and challenges of the topic,
    2. review related existing work in the literature, identify their shortcomings, and motivate the proposed solution,
    3. summarize compactly their contributions and novelty,
    4. make the document self-contained in terms of notations and definitions,
    5. formulate the problem mathematically,
    6. describe their solution, discuss the computational complexity,
    7. present their benchmarks and preprocessing, detail the performance measures used, design and discuss in detail the experiments, compare with alternative methods,
    8. point to the limitations of the work and motivate future research directions.

    The structure of your paper should be:

    - Introduction (bullet points i - ii - iii)
    - Problem Formulation (iv - v)
    - Proposed Solution (vi)
    - Numerical Experiments (vii)
    - Conclusions (viii)

### Deliverables

Your **solution** `MUST` contain a PDF document (i) with LSE candidate numbers (**no name please**), (ii) covering the points detailed under **WRITING**, (iii) with the guide in **TOPIC, SOFTWARE, DATA**.

Reports should be written in [JMLR style](./TeX_template) and are restricted to **9 content pages** (including figures and tables), followed by arbitrary number of pages containing references. If you feel that the 9 content page limit is tight, then think through what the main points you want to make are. The [template](./TeX_template) folder contains both a minimal example (directory [small](./TeX_template/small)) and a larger example (directory [large](./TeX_template/large)). The template style of both directories is the same, but the [large](./TeX_template/large) version contains more examples on how to write formulas, include figures and tables, and a [template.bib](./TeX_template/large/BIB/template.bib) file to help you using a unified style for references. Do not alter the document style (such as font size, font type, margins, …). Your report/study should be well-structured, to-the-point, self-contained and reproducible.

### Submission

The submission should be done via GitHub and Moodle, as for the previous assignments. Remember that this is a **2-step submission process**, and **both** steps must be completed **before the deadline**: 

* submit a PDF file with all your answers on the GitHub repository that was automatically created when you clicked on the assignment link. Please, make sure not to use any other repository.
* submit the link to your GitHub repository through [Moodle](https://moodle.lse.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=1159691) (on Moodle, you can submit a .txt/.docx/.pdf file containing your GitHub link).

### Important dates (meant in London time)
